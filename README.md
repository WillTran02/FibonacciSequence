# FibonacciSequence

Hello and welcome to the Fibonacci Sequence Repository!<br>

This repository contains a simple Fibonacci Number Generator, built using recursion and tested in a separate class file.<br>

There is only one file in <a href="src/main/java/com/sparta/wt/App.java">src/main</a> 
and only one file in <a href="src/test/java/com/sparta/wt/AppTest.java">src/test</a>.<br>

The class file in main holds two static methods for generating Fibonacci numbers; 
one generates the number at a particular position, while the other generates an array of 
all Fibonacci numbers up to a particular position.
